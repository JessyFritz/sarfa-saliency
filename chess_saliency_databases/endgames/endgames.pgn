{{A position which might have arisen from the Exchange Variation of the
Spanish.  White's better pawn structure gives him some advantage, since he can
create a  passed pawn on the kingside while Black, owing to his doubled pawns,
cannot do  the same on the queenside.  It is not clear if this advantage is
sufficient to win. In practical play I would expect wins and draws to be about
equally divided.}  *        }  *

{{Barcza-Golombek, Budapest 1952. This endgame certainly favours White.
Black's pawn structure is inferior because of the isolated d-pawn, while
White's king is the first to occupy the fourth rank. White has the obvious
plan of putting his king on d4 followed by using zugzwang to penetrate with
his king to c5 or e5. This was in fact the plan adopted by Barcza in the game,
but accurate defence by Golombek enabled him to hold the draw. Later (in 1966)
Bondarevsky analysed the ending and concluded that White could win with a
different and far from obvious plan: playing Ke3, threatening Kf4 and inducing
Black to weaken his kingside pawn structure further by playing ...g5. It is
hard to say whether this is correct, but at any rate it is clear that this
position is finely poised between a draw and a win.}  *                      }

{{St Petersburg-London, tele 1896. A classic ending. The game was halted at
this point with London conceding the  game. Chigorin then published some
analysis claiming that White could win. For  decades this was the accepted
opinion, but theory advances and it gradually  became recognised that
defending such position often requires the sacrifice of  the weak pawn (on a5
here). Fine, in his book Basic Chess Endings, suggested  that this plan should
lead to a draw. His analysis contained some errors, and  was refined by
Levenfish and Smyslov in their classic book Rook Endings. They  supported
Fine's conclusion, although some of the detailed variations differed  from
Fine's. That is the state of play today. Can computers unravel a position
 which took human analysts over half a century to unravel?.}  *    }  *

{{Keres-Alekhine, Dresden 1936. In this game between two of the leading
players of the pre-war period, Black has the advantage because he can create a
kingside passed pawn while White, thanks to his backward e-pawn, cannot create
a passed pawn. However, in a queen ending matters are never so easy, due to
the ever-present danger of perpetual check. In the game Black did succeed in

position with equal pawns looks as if it should be a draw, and indeed the
players agreed to a draw at this point. However, White has serious problems
because of his weak a3-pawn, which cannot be permanently defended by his
bishop. Once this pawn has been captured, Black has the chance to make a
second passed pawn by playing ...a5, which will stretch White's defence to the

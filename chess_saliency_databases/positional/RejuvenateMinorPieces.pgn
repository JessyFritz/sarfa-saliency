{ A glance might make you think that White’s better since Black’s knight and bishop are locked in while White’s minor pieces look good. However, that’s just an hallucination. Black immediately deals with that “locked in” problem by breaking down White’s pawn structure and, by doing so, also frees his pieces. } 27...Qh4 28.Be3 g5! { Problem solved! } 29.Qd2 gxf4 30.Bxf4 Nxe5 31.Kh1 Nxc4 32.Rxc4 Qh3 33.Qe2 Ra2! 34.Qd1 Kh8 { The king steps away from the open g-file while also setting up a possible ...Rg8. 34...Ra1 was also very strong. } 35.Rg1 { and now } 35...Ra1 { leaves Black with a clear advantage.
LESSON: If your minor pieces aren’t doing much, put all your energy into finding a way to rejuvenate them. Sometimes turning a poor piece into an active one seems impossible, and that might be reality. But the strong players rarely leave their pieces behind. In other words, just because a solution is hard to find doesn’t mean that it’s not there. }  *

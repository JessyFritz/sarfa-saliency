{ This is about punishing a inferior pawn structure (backward pawn) and undefended pawns and pieces. Black wants to play ...Ne6 followed by ...c7-c5. White wants to that c7-pawn to remain on c7 or c6, when the pawn will be weak and the c5-square will be White’s. } 17.Bg5! Bxg5 18.Nxg5 c6 ( 18...h6 19.Nf3 Ne6 20.Rac1 Rfc8 21.Qe3 ) 19.Rac1 Rc8 20.Qd3! { Taking note of the unprotected pawn on a6, the vulnerable h7-pawn, and another unprotected unit on f8. } 20...g6 21.Qa3 { Taking aim at f8 and a6. } 21...Ne6 ( 21...h6? 22.Nh7! ) 22.Nxe6 fxe6 23.Qxa6 { and White went on to win.
LESSON: When a player has weak squares (not to mention a backward, weak pawn), do your best to get rid of the opponent’s pieces (usually by trading), leaving the weak squares a permanent liability. }  1-0

15...Ne6 16.dxe5 { Black has a good game after 16.d5 Nf4. } 16...dxe5 { Freeing the dark-squared bishop and the d8-rook. } 17.Nhf5 Bb4! { The key move. Black stops White from moving his rook to d2 and forces White to play c2-c3 which leaves White with a hole on d3. } 18.c3 ( 18.Ba3 Nf4 { wins material. } ) 18...Nf4 { A good move, though a bit more accurate was 18...Bf8.

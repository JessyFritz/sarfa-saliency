{[%csl Ye5]} { The pawn on e5 is attacked once and defended twice. } 1.Nf3 { White overprotects e5 (it is now attacked once and defended three times) because it is a very important pawn that gains space and also helps protect his king at the moment. It may be noted also that overprotection might allow one of the defenders to perform another role at a crucial time, without compromising the pawn. } {[%cal Ge2e5,Gg3e5,Gf3e5,Rc6e5]} *

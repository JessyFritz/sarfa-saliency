{ In many cases, a long-term plus can easily win the game, even if the opponent still had a lot of play to go. } 18...b4 19.Ne2 c3 { and that passed pawn gives Black good winning chances. Notice White’s queen and c1-rook would be useless on that file. Also, Black will probably win any endgame (a nice thing to have!).

LESSON: Never hesitate to give yourself long-term plusses. In this case, the passed c3-pawn proudly screams: “You might have some play on the kingside, but if it doesn’t work out then my passed pawn will win in the endgame!” The more long-term plusses you have, the better. }  *

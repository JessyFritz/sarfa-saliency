{ Positions like this (for both sides) need very accurate play or their position might deteriorate. Black’s knight is fantastic since it blocks White’s d5-pawn, guards b7 and f7, and in some cases can leap forward with ...Nf5 or ...Nc4 or ...Ne4. Note that White’s d3-bishop can’t touch Black’s knight. This means that Black’s targets are White’s knight and dark-squared bishop. } 20...Bg4 { This follows our plan. 20...Bf5 is also good, but it calls for more dynamics and ignores Black’s main plan. } 21.Bf4 Bxf3 { One down, one to go! } 22.Rxf3 ( 22.Bxd6 Bxg2+ 23.Kxg2 Qxd6 ) 22...Be5 23.Raf1? ( 23.Bd2 { is better when White can trade off his bishop for the knight by Bb4, even though Black’s dark-squared bishop would take over the blockade on d6, leaving Black with a small edge. } 23...Rc8 ( 23...b5!? ) 24.Bb4 Qd7 $15 ) 23...Bxf4 24.Rxf4 Re3 { Other good moves: 24...Re5 and 24...Qg5. } 25.Qc3 ( 25.R4f3 Rxf3 26.Rxf3 Qg5 27.Qc3 Re8 { and White’s in serious trouble. } ) 25...Qg5 26.Qd4 ( 26.Qc5 Rxd3 27.Qxd6 Rd2 ) 26...Qe5! { In the actual game Black played 26...Rae8? when 27.Rf6 equalized, though Black won anyway. } 27.g3 ( 27.Qxe5 Rxe5 28.Rf6 Rxd5 ) 27...Rc8 { (27...Re8 and 27...f5 and 27...h5 are also good.) All those moves leave Black in charge.

LESSON: Moves mean nothing if they aren’t working for a plan. In this case the game was more or less equal but Black’s plan was to trade off all the minor pieces that could get rid of that blocking knight on d6. White failed to understand that, which allowed Black to take over the game. }  0-1

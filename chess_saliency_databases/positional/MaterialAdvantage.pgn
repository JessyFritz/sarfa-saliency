25...Rb6 26.c5?! { This looks like a winner, but that’s just not true. White should have ignored the win of an Exchange and maintain an edge by using his two bishops and (eventual) passed c-pawn: } ( 26.Be4! { This gives White an advantage. } 26...Ra6 27.Bd2! ( 27.Bb2 bxc4 28.bxc4 a4 29.Ba3 { also gives White a superior position. } ) 27...bxc4 ( 27...Rxd4? { is a serious mistake due to } 28.Rxd4 Qxd4 29.Bf4 ) 28.bxc4 Rad6 29.Bxa5 Rxd4 30.Rxd4 Rxd4 31.Rxd4 Bxd4 32.Qd2 e5 33.c5 Qb8 34.c6 { and White is better. } ) 26...Rxb7 27.c6 Ra7 28.cxd7 Qxd7 { and Black is fine due to his knight (which will be very happy on the d5-square) and his queenside pawn majority. Here’s the rest of the game: 29.Ra1 Qc6 30.Qb2 Qa8 31.Qd2 b4 32.Bb2 Nd5 33.Rc1 Kh7 34.Rc5 a4 35.bxa4 Rxa4 36.Rg3 Qb7 37.Qc2 Ra8 38.Qc4 Kg8 39.Bc1 Bf8 40.Rc6 Ra1 41.Kh2 Rb1, 1/2-1/2.
LESSON: Sometimes a small material advantage (26.c5) gives the opponent some positional plusses. In this case it turned into an even game, but in many situations positional plusses trump material. You have to assess positions like that very carefully since it can go either way. }  1/2-1/2

{ Black’s last move, 7...Nbd7, was a mistake since it doesn’t really have anywhere to go and it also blocks its queenside bishop and rook. White punishes it right away. } 8.cxd5 { If Black’s knight was still on b8 White would not play 8.cxd5 since Black’s queenside knight would move to c6. Now White has possibilities along the c-file. } 8...cxd5 ( 8...Nxd5 9.Nxd5 cxd5 10.O-O Nf6 { is Black’s best try, though after } 11.h3 { 11.Rc1 intending Bc7 is also good. } 11...Qb6 12.Qc2 Bd7 13.Rfc1 Bc6 ( 13...Rfc8 14.Bc7 ) 14.Ne5 Rfc8 15.a4 { when 15...a5 16.Ra3 (Grabbing the two bishops by 16.Nxc6 is also reasonable.) and now Black has to deal with moves like Rb3 or Rc3. In any case, White has an advantage } ) 9.O-O { 9.h3 is also good. After 9.0-0 or 9.h3 Black’s d7-knight is poorly placed. } 9...e6? { A very poor move. Instead, 9...Nb6 had to be played, though the knight isn’t particularly happy on that square due to an eventual a-pawn moving to a4 and a5 kicking it away. White has many good moves to choose: 10.h3, 10.Rc1, and of course 10.a4. } 10.Bd6 Re8 11.Nb5 Qb6?? ( 11...Nb8 12.Bxb8 Rxb8 13.Nxa7 Bd7 14.Ne5 Ra8 15.Nxd7 Qxd7 16.Nb5 { and White’s a pawn up. } ) ( 11...Bf8? 12.Bc7 Qe7 13.Nd6 ) 12.Bc7 Qc6 13.Rc1 Qa6 14.Nd6 { Threatening both the queen and the e8-rook. } 14...Qxa2 15.Qc2 { and Black’s queen is trapped.
LESSON: If you feel that an enemy piece isn’t well placed (the knight on d7), see if you can find a way to change the pawn structure (8.cxd5) if the change makes the poorly placed enemy piece even worse. }  1-0

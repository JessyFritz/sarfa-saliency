{ It&rsquo;s looks like a normal Tartakower Defense, and most players with White would castle here and then take aim at Black&rsquo;s kingside by moves like Ne5 and Bf5. Black, on the other hand, wants to play ...Bb7 and ...c7-c5. However, take another look! } 11.Bb5! { In the actual game White played the &ldquo;usual&rdquo; 11.0-0, but that let&rsquo;s Black off the hook. As it turns out, the hole on c6 (something you should notice right away) and the fact that Black&rsquo;s rook has moved to e8 too quickly gives White a great opportunity. } 11...Bb7 ( 11...Rf8 { , embarrassing, } 12.Bc6 Rb8 13.O-O Bb7 14.Qa4 Bxc6 15.Qxc6 { and White wins the d5-pawn. } ) 12.Bxf6 Bxf6 13.Qa4 Re7 14.Bc6 { and White wins material.

LESSON: If you see a weak point in the enemy position, stop everything and see if you can make use of it! }  *

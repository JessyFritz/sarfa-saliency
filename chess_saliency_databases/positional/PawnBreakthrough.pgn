{ Black needs to create counterplay, since White has a kingside space advantage and may launch an attack against the king. } 1...c5 { The very thematic c5 pawn break allows Black to undermine White's powerful pawn chain, creates space for his pieces and allows him to play on the queenside. } {[%cal Gc6c5]} *

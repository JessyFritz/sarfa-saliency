<p>
<B>slow64.exe</B> - You should use this executable possible. Running directly will give you the own GUI, but it can also be used as a UCI or winboard engine.<br/>
<B>slow64_noAvx.exe</B> - For older CPUs without AVX instruction set. Slower but otherwise the same. <br/>
<B>slow64_noPop.exe</B> - For older CPUS without popcount instruction (or AVX.) Slower but otherwise the same.

<h3>Using Slow Chess in Own GUI:</h3>

<P>If it's your turn and you click on one of your pieces, it will be selected, 
  and a white box appears around it. Then just click where you want to move it, or drag and release on the destination square. <br>
  Castling is done by clicking the king, then the square where he would end up 
  after castling. (FRC is an exception, to castle click the rook square after the king. Otherwise can be ambiguous.)<br> En Passant captures are performed by clicking the pawn and then 
  its destination square. <br>
  <br>
  <em>Move button</em>: Tells the computer to stop thinking and play the best 
  move its found so far if it's thinking, otherwise it will tell the computer 
  to start playing as the side to move.<br>
  <em>Retract button:</em> will take back the players last move so that he can 
  make a different one. <br>
  &lt; and &gt; : will move a half a move backward/forward respectively.<br>
  &lt;| and |&gt; :will go to the first and last move of the game.<br>
  Clicking on the transcript will set the board to the move clicked on.<br>
  <br>
  The <em>Difficulty level</em> uses all limits set. (Let's say it's set to 7 
  ply, 5 seconds. If it completes a 7 ply search before 5 seconds it will stop, 
  otherwise it will stop after 5 seconds no matter how far it has searched.) The 
  52 ply is meant to be used for time based games, since it will always (except 
  certain endgame situations) reach the time limit before it reaches 52 ply. Seconds 
  per move defaults to 0, and when it's set to zero it uses the time control to 
  choose how long to think about its next move, instead of thinking a set amount 
  of time per move.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  <I>Analysis</I>: To start analysis of the position currently on the board, click 
  the &quot;Analyze&quot; button in the side window. A window will appear below the board 
  which will display the principle variation of the best move or best moves found. 
  If you don't mind much slower best move analysis, you can use the '+' and '-' 
  button to have the computer calculate the 2nd best-6th best moves in addition 
  to the best. You can also turn on the analysis window while playing against 
  the computer from the options menu. <br>
  <br>
  <I>Multi-Threaded search</I>: The default is 1 thinking thread. For better and quicker analysis, you can increase this number
  under Search->Threads. This setting is saved in the EngineGUI.dft file. More threads is only a benefit up the the actual number of hardware threads your CPU supports, and additionally you might not want to use the hardware max 
  threads or other programs might become sluggish.
<br><br>
  <em>Displayed Search Info</em>: When the computer is thinking, it will display 
  info about the search unless this option is unchecked. It will display the furthest 
  depth to which it searched a move completely (with a * afterwards if not all 
  moves were searched to that depth, a * after the eval value means there's no 
  value for this move at the current depth), the number of nodes it searched, 
  and search speed in Kilonodes/sec, and the evaluation value of the best move.<br>
  <br>
 <em>Options->Settings</em> : Set Player Name, Book Dir, Use Book, SyzygyPath, Draw Offers, Resign, Eval White POV
<br/>
<br>
  In the window beneath a player's time, 1R, 2p beneath black's time would mean 
  that black has 1 more rook than white, and 2 more pawns.<br>
  The large print top clock is the time left for a player to complete his move 
  (according to the time limit set on the menu.) The bottom is the total time 
  the player has taken to make his moves so far. If the time left runs out, you 
  would lose the game by the rules of chess, but in this program your clock just 
  stays at zero and you're free to continue to play.</P>
<P><b>Note on the opening book: </b>You manually add or remove positions from the
opening book with the 3 and 6 keys. (Also 1 or 2 keys = position prefered by
black. 4 or 5 keys = position prefered by white.) Remember to Save the book when you're
done, it never autosaves. You can also add .pgns to the book. If you load an opening book the positions
will be added to whatever is in the book in memory. Slow Chess can't handle really large books.&nbsp;</P>

<h3>Using Slow Chess as a UCI or Winboard Engine:</h3>

<ul>
<li>The same slow64.exe can be used as a winboard or UCI engine in any interface that supports those protocols.</li>
<li>On startup it will try to load the endgame neural nets, bitbases and opening book. The data files are exepected to be in the same directory as the executable.</li>
<li>Winboard settings are all saved in <i>engineWB.dft</i>.</li>
<li>You can set the winboard settings from the Slow GUI using Options->Winboard Settings, or by directly text editing the save file <i>engineWB.dft</i>.</li>
<li>The transposition table size is additionally settable from command line with -TT128 where 128 is the size in MBs.</li>
<li>Note : actual TT size will always be a power of 2. So 64, 128, 256, etc. Due to a reduction in TTEntry size, allocated memory will be less.</li>
<li>Own Opening Book usage can be turned off in winboard settings. Under UCI it's the ownBook UCI option.</li>
<li>Slow Chess saves its games under winboard to winboardgames.pgn in the directory 
  it is run (can be turned off in winboard settings.)</li>
<li>FRC / Chess960 variant is supported.</li>
</ul>
v1.9 or later
<ul>
<li>UCI multi-threading uses the <i>"Threads"</i> setting in engine options.
<li>Winboard multi-threaded search is supported, respecting the <i>cores</i> command. Settable in WinBoard under <i>"Options->Common Engine->Max nr of CPUs"</i></li>
<li>If there exists a winboard GUI that doesn't send the cores command, the default is set by "Threads=#" in engineWB.dft</li>
</ul>
v2.1 or later
<ul>
<li>You can set the SyzygyPath option to use the Syzygy endgame tablebases. This is exposed as a standard option in UCI, and in Options->Settings for Winboard/own GUI.</li>
</ul>
<p>

<h3>Additional notes:</h3>

<p>For those who like to know the country of their 
  winboard engines, Slow Chess' official country of origin is the United States.</P>
<P>The piece images are by Josh Hess.</P>
<p>The engine logo on the page is by Yujin Choo</p>
Version 2.2 and later contains third party code for Syzygy Tablebase support.<BR/> The Syzygy tablebase code is by Ronald de Man, with additional modications for fathom by basil and Jon Dart.<br/>
See <a href="https://github.com/jdart1/Fathom">Fathom Github</a>
<P> If you want a more classic feel try version 1.4 or 1.5. They are weaker but don't do aggresive pruning so feel more like the chess programs of 15 years ago.</p>
